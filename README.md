## Language & Theme

Open **Settings** to switch between Arabic and English or toggle light/dark/system themes. Preferences are saved locally and restored on relaunch.

## Editing quiz questions

Questions live in `lib/app/data/repositories/quiz_repository.dart`. Update or extend the list; each question includes translations, a trait tag, and reverse scoring flag.

## Customising design

- Global colours and typography live in `lib/app/core/theme/app_theme.dart` and `lib/app/core/utils/app_colors.dart`.
- Update gradients and radii in the same files to match branding tweaks.
- Replace assets inside `assets/images/` and fonts within `assets/fonts/` for new visuals.

## Mock data

- Emotion cues and compare profiles live in `lib/app/data/repositories/insights_repository.dart` and `lib/app/data/repositories/compare_repository.dart`.
- Quiz scoring logic resides inside `lib/app/modules/quiz/controllers/quiz_controller.dart`.

## Notes

The app is architected using GetX bindings and controllers, keeping views declarative and lean. Replace mock repositories with API-powered data sources when integrating a backend.
